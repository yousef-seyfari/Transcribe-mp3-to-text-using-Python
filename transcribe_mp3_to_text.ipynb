    "Since this transcription is based on the request from the Google Web Speech API, when size of audio wave file exceeds some limitations (I think it is around 10MB), the request fails. When converting mp3 file to wave, size of wave file increases dramatically, i.e., if size of mp3 is around 14MB, the size of output wave file would be 150MB. Hence, in this step we split a single wave file to multiple small wave files and store them in subfolder called parts."
