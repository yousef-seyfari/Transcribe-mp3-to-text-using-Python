Transcription of an mp3 file into text (Speech Recognition)

In this tutorial I want to explain how to use Python to transcribe an mp3 file named p1.mp3 and extract text, step by step. The mp3 file is stored in input_dir.

Steps:
  1. Convert mp3 file to wave file format using ffmpeg
  2. Get the length of wav file you want to transcribe in milliseconds
  3. Split single wave file to multiple small wave files
  4. Get the list of small wave files
  5. Transcribe each small wave file
